# Script to update Golang version

Sometimes to update Golang is bored when we use Linux.
Thinking about it, I created a script to automatize this process.

- You need to download the go version:
```
https://go.dev/dl/
```

- Giving permissions to execute the script:
```
chmod u+x go-update.sh
```

- Execute the script:
```
./go-update.sh
```
